const WEB_DESCRIPTIONS = ` also known as a confectionery or candy store, is a retail store 
                          that specializes in selling sweets, desserts, and sugary treats. These shops can 
                          vary in size and style, ranging from small family-run businesses to large chain stores.
                          Sweet shops have been around for centuries, with different cultures developing their 
                          own unique confections. In medieval Europe, sweets were a luxury reserved for the wealthy,
                          as sugar was expensive. Over time, as sugar became more affordable, candy-making evolved,
                          leading to the establishment of dedicated confectionery shops. In many countries, traditional 
                          sweet shops became an integral part of local culture, offering handcrafted treats made from 
                         recipes passed down through generations.`;
